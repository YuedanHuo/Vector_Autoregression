    """
    Compute the posterior mean and covariance for A in a VAR model with heteroskedastic errors,
    using log-transformed Lambda values (log_lambdas), y, and z.

    Parameters:
    y (numpy.ndarray): The data matrix of shape (T, N), where T is the number of time periods, and N is the number of variables.
    z (numpy.ndarray): The exogenous variable matrix of shape (T, M), where M is the number of exogenous variables.
    log_lambdas (numpy.ndarray): The log-transformed volatility matrix of shape (N, T), where each column represents log(Lambda_t).
    mu_A (numpy.ndarray): Prior mean for a row of A, of shape (N ,).
    Sigma_A (numpy.ndarray): Prior covariance matrix for a row of A, of shape (N, N).
    Pi (numpy.ndarray): The coefficient matrix Pi of shape (N, M), used to transform z.
    T (int): Number of time periods (rows of y and z).

    Returns:
    mu_A_prime (numpy.ndarray): Posterior mean for A, of shape (N * N,).
    Sigma_A_prime (numpy.ndarray): Posterior covariance matrix for A, of shape (N * N, N * N).
